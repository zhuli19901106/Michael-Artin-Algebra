Problem sets of the book "Algebra" by Michael Artin.

I'm trying to learn some abstract algebra, hopefully it would apply to later study of coding theory and whatever I might deal with in the future.

This problem set is given by the "Algebra" open course from ocw.mit.edu.

There's a high chance of me never being able to finish this repo, as I'd expect this book to be a real challenge for me. Still, I'll try to persist and manage.

As for how I'm gonna do my homework, I'd prefer pencil and paper, forget about Tex, because I can't afford the time on that stuff.

Due to my terrible handwriting, these photos might vary from being slightly to highly unintelligible.

Please understand :)
