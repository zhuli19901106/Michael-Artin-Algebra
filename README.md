Problem sets of the book **"Algebra" by Michael Artin**.

Zhu Li, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University

I'm trying to learn some abstract algebra, hopefully it would help with later study of coding theory or whatever I might deal with in the future.

This problem set is given by the "Algebra" open course from [**MIT Open Courseware**](ocw.mit.edu).

**There's a high chance of me never being able to finish this repo**, as I'd expect this book to be a real challenge for me. Still, I'll try to persist and manage.

As for how I'm gonna do my homework, I'd prefer pencil and paper. I can't afford the time on TeX.

Due to my terrible handwriting, these photos might vary from being slightly to highly unintelligible.

Please understand :)

FYI, the MIT OCW links are here:

1. [Algebra I](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-701-algebra-i-fall-2010/)
2. [Algebra II](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-702-algebra-ii-spring-2011/)

Good news, there're lecture videos available from Harvard Open Course, link is [here](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra).
